        <h3>Akungba Journal of Politics and Society (AJPS)</h3>
        <p>
            Akungba Journal of Politics and Society (AJPS) is a biannual (July and December) peer reviewed interdisciplinary journal domiciled in the Department of Political Science, Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria. The 21st century world crowded with uncertainties in the political and social facets of human existence becomes imperative than ever, for scholars in the Political and Social Sciences to engage in providing analytical and critical analysis to issues relating to politics and society. AJPS as a peer reviewed bi-annual journal emerges as a scintillating platform to harness scholarly writings of the academics to illuminate and address the challenges emanating from the society, politics, economy and the physical environment as they have implication for politics. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The journal offers a critical analysis on politics with emphasis on its social roots and inherent consequences. Politics, the world over is defined by conflicts, whether among individuals, sub-national and national parliaments, civil society groups, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), government ministries and agencies, the military, religious institutions and places of worship, the university community, the family, domestic and international economy, and the workplace. Man seeks politics for a good society, and on the other hand, exploring the factors hindering a good society, and those propelling it. 
        </p>
        <p>

It also welcomes submissions that provides a critical analysis of the transformations in political discourses, thoughts, and conventions. It further seeks contributions on critical and pressing contemporary issues, provoking serious thinking on relevant policy action/directions, motivations of the policy makers, scholars, and social and political actors. It encourages rigorous methodological research techniques that combines empirical and theoretical reflections.
        </p>
