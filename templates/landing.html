        <h3>Akungba Journal of Politics and Society (AJPS)</h3>
        <p>
            Akungba Journal of Politics and Society (AJPS) is a biannual (July
            and December) peer reviewed interdisciplinary journal domiciled in
            the Department of Political Science, Adekunle Ajasin University,
            Akungba-Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria. The 21st century world crowded
            with uncertainties in the political and social facets of human
            existence becomes imperative than ever, for scholars in the
            Political and Social Sciences to engage in providing analytical and
            critical analysis to issues relating to politics and society. AJPS
            as a peer reviewed bi-annual journal emerges as a scintillating
            platform to harness scholarly writings of the academics to
            illuminate and address the challenges emanating from the society,
            politics, economy and the physical environment as they have
            implication for politics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The journal offers a critical analysis on politics with emphasis on
            its social roots and inherent consequences. Politics, the world over
            is defined by conflicts, whether among individuals, sub-national and
            national parliaments, civil society groups, non-governmental
            organisations (NGOs), government ministries and agencies, the
            military, religious institutions and places of worship, the
            university community, the family, domestic and international
            economy, and the workplace. Man seeks politics for a good society,
            and on the other hand, exploring the factors hindering a good
            society, and those propelling it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The AJPS thus, seek original paper contributions that encompasses
            all the aforementioned, including those proposing alternative and
            radical visions; interrogating inequalities in society in diverse
            aspects (race, class, gender, and national, etc.). It also welcomes
            submissions that provides a critical analysis of the transformations
            in political discourses, thoughts, and conventions. It further seeks
            contributions on critical and pressing contemporary issues,
            provoking serious thinking on relevant policy action/directions,
            motivations of the policy makers, scholars, and social and political
            actors. It encourages rigorous methodological research techniques
            that combines empirical and theoretical reflections.
        </p>
        <p>
            The journal welcomes submissions from diverse Social Sciences and
            Humanities disciplines including but not limited to Political
            Science, Anthropology, Sociology, Geography, Public Administration,
            Philosophy, Law, Mass Communication, History, Economics, Criminology
